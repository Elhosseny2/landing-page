# landing-page

This is a simple landing page I created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. 

It's a beginner-level project designed to practice basic HTML and CSS skills.

**Features**

A structured layout with a header, main content, and footer.

Styling with CSS to create a visually appealing design.

Basic responsiveness to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes.

**What I Learned?**

How to use HTML to structure a webpage.

Basic CSS techniques, including styling with classes and IDs.

It was a great opportunity to practice Flexbox and explore different of cool CSS properties.

I'm learning german so it was even a good chance to improve the language, hence the site is totally german represented.
